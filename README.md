üí° 1. Comments:

</aside>

- **A backtrack problem** often is a **combination problem.**

<aside>
üí° 2. Definitions:

</aside>

- **Variable set:** is the set that contains variables that need to be assigned value ‚áí solving a problem is a task that finds and assigns proper values for variables.
- **Domain**: is set of value can assign for each variable.
- **Proposal**: is a tuple can assign into a variable set and expect that is a solution.
- **Space of a problem**: is the set of proposals that contains all solutions of the problem if exist.
- **Constraint of a problem**: conditions to accept a proposal.
- **Solution set**: proposals based on constraints of its problem.

        *In the AI field, the first goal is finding the first solution and then think about improving or finding a better algorithm.*

üí° 3. Evaluation:

</aside>

- Evaluating the complexity of a backtrack solving of a **combination problem.**
    - Time ~ O(M^N)
    - Space ~ O(N)
    
    *N is the number of variables in the problem.*
    
    *M is the average number of choices of each variable in the problem.*
    

<aside>
üí° 4. Backtracking improvement:

</aside>

- Sort the order of variables in the set.
- Selected a proper order value for each variable, (*example: increase/decrease order*).

üí° 6. Backtracking Solving Model:

</aside>

![Untitled](./4.png)

- **BK_Problem** is an abstract class as a set of variable ‚áí backtracking solving as same as the task that we find accepted proposals for solutions.
- **Variable**: is a class that describes a variable including (value + its domain)
- **Domain:** is a class that describes a domain.
- **Proposal**: is a class as a set of values (we use a set of entities of Object class to accept for every type of values ‚áí polymorphism)

<aside>
üí° ‚áí When using the model we have some requirements:

- Initializing a specific class as a subclass of BK_Problem that describes a specific problem we need to solve.
- In that class, we need:
    - Overriding 2 methods: accepted() and accepted(index,value)
    - Build the contructor and initialize the set of variables in it.
